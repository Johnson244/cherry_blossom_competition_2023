## About

The tradition of celebrating cherry blossoms, which originated in Japan, has become increasingly popular in various cultures over the past few decades. 
This event has great cultural and economic significance for many cities and regions worldwide, which gave us the motivation to study and model it in-depth. 
As a result, we developed respective Convolutional Neural Network models and XGBoost models to predict the blossom dates of cherry trees in 2023.
Specifically, Our Repo contains the highest likelihood blossom dates of cherry trees in Kyoto, Japan, Washington DC, USA, Vancouver, Canada, and Liestal, Switzerland.
